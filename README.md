# Visual Studio Code Language Packs (deprecated)

> The currently supported Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code can be found in the [vscode-loc](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-loc) repository.

This repository contains files to build deprecated Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. These were originally in the main [vscode-loc](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-loc) repository but have been removed because they are no longer maintained.

Language pack extensions are published to the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Installs)

The languages in this respository are listed here:

|Language|Visual Studio Code Language ID|MLCP Language Code|
|--------|--------|--------|
|**Bulgarian**|bg|Bulgarian (bg-bg)
|**English (United Kingdom)**|en-GB|English (en-gb)
|**Hungarian**|hu|Hungarian (hu-hu)
|**Indonesian**|id|Indonesian (id-id)
|**Dutch**|nl|Dutch (nl-nl)
|**Pseudo**|ps|Pseudo (ps-ps)
|**Ukrainian**|uk|Ukrainian (uk-uk)
